**Objective:** Prepare UK retail time series data for forecasting through rigorous preprocessing and analysis.

**What it does:**

* **Loading & Cleaning:** Imports 1M+ UK transactions, fills missing `customer_id`, forward-fills negative prices, and clips negative quantities.

* **Resampling:** Aggregates data daily (`.resample('D')`) for sales, quantity, and transaction counts.

* **Stationarity:** ADF test confirms original data is marginally stationary (p=0.042); log-differencing improves stationarity significantly.

* **Transformation:** Applies `log(x + 1)` and first-order differencing to normalize and stabilize data.

* **Autocorrelation:** ACF/PACF (24 lags) highlight temporal dependencies for ARIMA tuning.

* **Decomposition:** Additive decomposition (168-period) reveals weekly seasonality and trend patterns.

* **Export:** Saves cleaned dataset with datetime index and key features for modeling.

**Key insights:**

* Stationarity improves with transformationâ€”critical for model accuracy.
* Weekly patterns reflect real-world business cycles (e.g., weekend closures).
* Data issues (returns, zero sales) need contextual handling.
* ACF/PACF guide parameter selection for forecasting models.


**Key takeaway:** Transformation, stationarity testing, and decomposition are essential steps for reliable time series forecasting.
